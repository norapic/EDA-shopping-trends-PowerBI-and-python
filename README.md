This project is an exploratory data analysis using a Kaggle dataset

# Description
This project is meant to display basic EDA skills using Jupyter notebook and PowerBI. The notebook contains classes of methods to analyse two different types of variables: quantivative and qualitative. The classes are then used to answer hypothetical questions about the dataset such as : "what is the average customer's age ?".
In the PowerBI dashboard, interactive visuals such as maps and graphs were created. The data were imported as csv files in both approaches.

# Resources
The data set used is from the platform **Kaggle:** https://www.kaggle.com/code/iamsouravbanerjee/decoding-customer-shopping-trends/input

# Analysis
## Jupyter notebook
The analysis was made using basic python data analysis libraries: numpy, pandas and matplotlib. Also wordcloud was used to create particular visuals for the qualitative variables.
Example of a word cloud displaying states names depending on the number of purchases in each one:

## PowerBI dashboard
Simple visuals of PowerBI were used, along with filters.
Example a visual created:

Interactive map displaying the number of customers in each states.
